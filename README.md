# craw_plotathon_2021
entry for the 20212 DataTas plot-a-thon

My final figure is "himalayas.gif".

Also included here is everything needed to recreate the plot (I hope!):
- himalayas.m, plotting script written for MATLAB R2018b Update 7 (9.5.0.1298439), with the mapping toolbox installed
- death_zone_peaks.txt, a list of death zone peaks and their lat and long which I pulled from the Himalayan Index at alpine-club.co.uk
- ./flags/, a directory containing .png images of country flags. I got these from https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons
- hiker-overnight.png, a symbol from the IAN open-coure symbol library https://ian.umces.edu/media-library
